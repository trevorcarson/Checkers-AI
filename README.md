# Checkers-AI
Implementation of the game of Checkers, as well as an AI to play against.
- We used the basics of a 2D array to visualise the game of checkers. This was a challenging project, as it required us to understand how exactly to implement the game correctly according to the basic rules of checkers. In building the AI, we struggled at first with how to determine the best move possible. It was easy to move pieces at random, but building structure around how the computer plays was challenging. We settled with trying to king any piece on the board first, then looking at other moves.
